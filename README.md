# Graph Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of essential graph algorithms in C++. These algorithms are useful for understanding and solving various graph-related problems efficiently.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
   - Explores nodes level by level.
   - Useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
   - Explores as far as possible along each branch.
   - Useful for pathfinding and topological sorting.

3. **Prim's Algorithm**
   - Finds the minimum spanning tree (MST) for a weighted undirected graph.
   - Implements a greedy approach.

4. **Kruskal's Algorithm**
   - Finds the MST for a weighted undirected graph.
   - Utilizes the union-find data structure.

5. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
   - Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
   - Assumes non-negative edge weights.

6. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
   - Computes shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes.
   - Handles graphs with negative edge weights.

7. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**
   - Computes shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph.
   - Utilizes dynamic programming.
